      <p>To all of the ONYX fam, riders and customers. The warehouses will be shut down for a couple days but it won't cause any significant delays in shipping. Please be patient. I understand you all must have a lot of questions and I promise we will provide answers to every single one of them as soon as we possibly can. If you currently have an order, it will be shipped in a timely manner.</p>

      <p>Once you are part of the ONYX family, you will be forever and we’ll do everything we can to take care of you and get you riding. We’d like to make that happen as soon as possible. Sport mode style. Again, please be patient.</p>
